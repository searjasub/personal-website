        </p>
        <p>
            A little about myself... I'm from Santiago, Chile. I have been in the US for 3 years.
            <br>I married the most amazing girl in the whole universe. Her name is Kellee. I have been married for 2 and
            a
            half years.
            We have a 15-month-old son. His name is Sear as well. We will welcome baby number 2 by the end of April
            2019!
            (btw it's a girl)
            <br>I love music and dancing, in fact here is a gif of my son dancing too.
            <br>I'm student at Neumont College, pursuing a computer science degree.
