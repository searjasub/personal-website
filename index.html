    </p>
    <p>
    A little about myself... I'm from Santiago, Chile. I have been in the US for 3 years.
        <br>I married the most amazing girl in the whole universe. Her name is Kellee. I have been married for 2 and a half years.
        We have a 15-month-old son. His name is Sear as well. We will welcome baby number 2 by the end of April 2019! (btw it's a girl)
        <br>I'm student at Neumont College, pursuing a computer science degree.
