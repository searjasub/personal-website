    <br><br>For right now my focus is getting my degree. After I finish college, I will work in the industry
    in Utah. Start building my resume and eventually move to a place more warm.
    <br>My wife and I love kids and we are planing to have 8 in total. We have to down so we will see when the next 6
    will come.
    <br>I'm also an open mindset person. I know we can't control the future and outcomes, so I will make sure I'm ready
    for whatever life will come up with.
